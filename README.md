# Mission_to_Mars
The purpose of this project adjust the an original code to adjust a current Web App to include all four of the hemisphere images of Mars using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

Derivables include:

Derivable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

Derivable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using Python and HTML, add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to the scraping.py file, update the Mongo database, and modify the index.html file so the webpage contains all the information collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

Derivavble 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
Update the web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
